## 📁 Log Files Created

The `app_log/` directory is automatically created with 4 log files:

```
app_log/
├── resume_advisor.log      # ✅ Main log (all activities)
├── errors.log               # ✅ Errors only
├── api_requests.log         # ✅ HTTP requests/responses
└── openai_calls.log         # ✅ OpenAI prompts/responses with tokens
```

### Verification from Terminal Output:
```
2025-10-21 18:34:30 | INFO | root.setup_logging:116 | ================================================================================
2025-10-21 18:34:30 | INFO | root.setup_logging:117 | Resume Advisor Platform - Logging initialized
2025-10-21 18:34:30 | INFO | root.setup_logging:118 | Log directory: C:\Codes\resume_creator\app_log

## 🔒 Security Features

### Automatic Data Sanitization
Sensitive information is automatically redacted in logs:
- `api_key` → `***REDACTED***`
- `password` → `***REDACTED***`
- `token` → `***REDACTED***`
- `secret` → `***REDACTED***`
- `authorization` → `***REDACTED***`

### Data Truncation
Large payloads are truncated to prevent log bloat:
- Main logs: 500 characters with ellipsis
- OpenAI logs: 2000 characters (preserves beginning and end)
- Truncation message shows total length

---

## 📊 Log File Rotation

All log files have automatic rotation configured:

| File | Max Size | Backups | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| `resume_advisor.log` | 10 MB | 5 | All application logs |
| `errors.log` | 5 MB | 3 | Errors and critical failures |
| `api_requests.log` | 10 MB | 5 | HTTP request/response tracking |
| `openai_calls.log` | 20 MB | 10 | OpenAI prompts, responses, tokens |

**Rotation ensures**: Disk space never runs out due to logging.

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

### Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
# Watch main application log in real-time
Get-Content app_log\resume_advisor.log -Wait -Tail 50

# Watch errors only
Get-Content app_log\errors.log -Wait -Tail 20

# Watch API requests
Get-Content app_log\api_requests.log -Wait -Tail 30

# Watch OpenAI calls (shows all prompts/responses and token usage)
Get-Content app_log\openai_calls.log -Wait -Tail 20
```

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Watch main application log
tail -f app_log/resume_advisor.log

# Watch errors only
tail -f app_log/errors.log

# Watch API requests
tail -f app_log/api_requests.log

# Watch OpenAI calls
tail -f app_log/openai_calls.log
```

## 💡 Usage for Engineers

### 1. Debugging Issues
- **Problem**: Upload fails
- **Solution**: Check `resume_advisor.log` for upload details
- **Look for**: File size, type detection, extraction logs

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- **Check**: Duration logs for every operation
- **Files**: All logs include timing information
- **Format**: `Duration: 12.34s` or `Duration: 1234.56ms`

### 3. Cost Tracking
- **Check**: `openai_calls.log`
- **Look for**: `Tokens - Prompt: XXX, Completion: YYY, Total: ZZZ`
- **Calculate**: Approximate cost based on OpenAI pricing

### 4. Error Analysis
- **Check**: `errors.log` first for all errors
- **Then check**: `resume_advisor.log` for full context
- **Stack traces**: Always included with full error details

### 5. API Request Tracking
- **Check**: `api_requests.log`
- **See**: All HTTP requests with method, path, status, duration
- **Filter**: By endpoint to track specific API calls
