## Setup Instructions

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file contains your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
MAX_TOKENS=4000
TEMPERATURE=0.3
```

### 4. Run the Server

```powershell
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Features Implemented

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. **Upload Resume Endpoint** (`POST /api/upload-resume`)
   - Accepts PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
   - Extracts text and stores with unique ID
   - Returns resume_id for analysis

2. **Analyze Resume Endpoint** (`POST /api/analyze`)
   - Takes resume_id and job_description
   - Performs comprehensive AI analysis:
     - Extracts overlapping skills
     - Identifies skill gaps with importance levels
     - Scores across 9 dimensions
     - Generates overall fit score
     - Creates actionable recommendations
   - Returns complete analysis with unique analysis_id

3. **Generate Report Endpoint** (`POST /api/generate-report/{analysis_id}`)
   - Creates professional PDF report
   - Includes all analysis results
   - Returns download URL

4. **Download Report Endpoint** (`GET /api/download-report/{report_id}`)
   - Serves generated PDF report for download

### 9 Evaluation Dimensions

Each resume is scored (0-100) on:

1. **Relevance of Experience** (20% weight) - How well experience matches the role
2. **Impact and Achievements** (15% weight) - Demonstrated accomplishments
3. **Technical Proficiency** (15% weight) - Required technical skills
4. **Clarity and Structure** (10% weight) - Resume formatting and organization
5. **Quantifiable Results** (10% weight) - Metrics and measurable outcomes
6. **Communication and Writing Quality** (8% weight) - Professional writing
7. **Growth and Progression** (8% weight) - Career trajectory
8. **Innovation and Problem-Solving** (9% weight) - Creative solutions
9. **ATS Compatibility** (5% weight) - Applicant tracking system optimization

Overall score is a weighted average of all dimensions.

### Frontend (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

1. **Landing Page** (`/`)
   - Three-step wizard interface:
     1. Upload resume (drag-drop or browse)
     2. Paste job description
     3. Review and start analysis
   - Real-time validation
   - Loading indicators
   - Modern, responsive design

2. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
   - Overall fit score with color-coded gauge
   - Executive summary
   - Interactive radar chart (Chart.js) showing dimension scores
   - Four tabbed sections:
     - **Overview**: Visual summary and key metrics
     - **Skills Analysis**: Overlapping skills (green) and gaps (red) with importance levels
     - **Dimension Breakdown**: Detailed scores, analysis, and recommendations for each dimension
     - **Recommendations**: Prioritized action items
   - Download PDF Report button
   - Start New Analysis button

### Utilities

1. **OpenAI Client** (`utils/openai_client.py`)
   - Secure API key management from .env
   - Token counting and cost estimation
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Structured completion helpers

2. **Scoring Engine** (`utils/scoring_engine.py`)
   - Evaluates each dimension using GPT-4
   - Returns score (0-100), analysis, and recommendations
   - Calculates weighted overall score
   - Generates prioritized recommendations

3. **Resume Analyzer** (`utils/resume_analyzer.py`)
   - Orchestrates complete analysis workflow
   - Extracts overlapping skills using AI
   - Identifies skill gaps with importance levels
   - Generates executive summary
   - Compiles all results

4. **PDF Generator** (`utils/pdf_generator.py`)
   - Creates professional multi-page reports using ReportLab
   - Includes cover page, scores table, skills analysis, dimension details
   - Color-coded scores and visual elements
   - Timestamps and formatting

## API Documentation

FastAPI auto-generates interactive API docs at:
- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

## Usage Workflow

1. User uploads resume (PDF/DOCX/TXT)
2. User pastes target job description
3. System analyzes resume using GPT-4:
   - Compares skills and experience
   - Scores across 9 dimensions
   - Identifies gaps and opportunities
4. Dashboard displays interactive results
5. User can download professional PDF report

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.x, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, Chart.js
- **File Processing**: PyPDF2, docx2txt

## Security Notes

- CORS enabled for local development (adjust for production)
- File size limited to 10MB
- No authentication (personal use, local deployment)
- API keys stored in .env (not committed to git)

## Next Steps for Enhancement (Optional)

- Add user authentication and history
- Implement caching for faster repeat analyses
- Add batch processing for multiple resumes
- Create resume templates and suggestions
- Add A/B comparison of different resume versions
- Integrate with LinkedIn profile import
- Add multi-language support

## Troubleshooting

### OpenAI API Errors
- Verify API key in .env file
- Check API rate limits and quotas
- Ensure sufficient credits in OpenAI account

### File Upload Issues
- Verify file format (PDF, DOCX, TXT only)
- Check file size (< 10MB)
- Ensure text is extractable (not scanned images)

### PDF Generation Errors
- Check ReportLab installation
- Verify write permissions in reports/ directory
- Check disk space

## Cost Estimation

Average cost per analysis (using GPT-4 Turbo):
- ~15,000-20,000 tokens per complete analysis
- Approximate cost: $0.15-$0.30 per analysis
- (Varies based on resume/job description length)
